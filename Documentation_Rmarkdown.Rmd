## Data Understanding

#### Value ranges

#### Attribute correlations
We tested for correlation between paired numeric samples using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient and found the following pairs of attributes to be correlated:


```{r correlations}
knitr::kable(corr_pairs_name, caption = "Pairs of correlated attributes", col.names = c("Attribute 1","Attribute 2","Correlation coefficient"))
```

#### Basic statistics

```{r statistics}
summary(data_collection[c(1:24)])
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Data Exploration Report

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
